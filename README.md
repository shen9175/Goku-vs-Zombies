# Goku-vs-Zombies
a 2D game realtime battle model, watch video on youtube

This little game was built 2 years ago in the game class.
It was developed
on Microsoft XNA with C#.

The coding style is not very good at that time. Only 2 main files plus an entry file.

It was a homework for building a realtime battle system
It required most common functions in modern game.

I downloaded some sprites of Goku in DraganBalls and some zombies
on the Internet, So I called it "Goku vs Zombies".

It required implementing one short range weapon like sword,
I implemented as Goku's Power Pole.
It required implementing one long range weapon like pistol,
I implemented as Goku's Turtle Wave: Kamehameha


This small model impements the attack and defence system.
Make up some formula combining some character's
parameters such as dexterity, strength, armor value and some randomness
to determine the damage range, miss rate and final damage values.

Implement freeze time when changing weapon
Implement reloading freeze time after 10 turtle waves
Implement HP bar and HP drop animation on the head
Implement death animation and skull icon in status screen
Implement status of Goku changing in realtime
Zombie who near the Goku in certain perimeter will also be shown

The zombie's AI is basically based on random.
When its HP below 1/3, it will escape.

Implement dynamic collision detection without
predefined collision data layer tile help.
Under this technique, random map generation
(random trees generated when running) is implemented.


Implement zombie's random name
Implement zombie's random trash talk
Try to made this little game all things dynamically
and all the things generated in realtime.


All the sprites are from Internet, only for
self-education purpose. Goku is the copyright of 
Akira Toriyama. Don't know if Bandai Namco
has the copyright of Goku's game. I just borrow it for
self education and will not use it for other purpose.
